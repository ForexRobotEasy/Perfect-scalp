# Perfect Scalp Expert Advisor

## Description

Perfect Scalp is a powerful and effective Forex robot designed for scalping strategies on multiple currency pairs. It aims to generate consistent profits by taking advantage of short-term price fluctuations in the market. This expert advisor allows you to scalp the market on six different currency pairs simultaneously, namely GBPUSD, GBPJPY, USDCHF, EURAUD, EURUSD, and EURCHF. It operates on the M5 timeframe and utilizes specific entry and exit logic for each symbol.

## Input Parameters

- **Symbol1**: The first currency pair symbol (default: GBPUSD)
- **Symbol2**: The second currency pair symbol (default: GBPJPY)
- **Symbol3**: The third currency pair symbol (default: USDCHF)
- **Symbol4**: The fourth currency pair symbol (default: EURAUD)
- **Symbol5**: The fifth currency pair symbol (default: EURUSD)
- **Symbol6**: The sixth currency pair symbol (default: EURCHF)

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the expert advisor. It checks if all necessary symbols are available for trading. If any of the specified symbols are not available, an error message is printed, and the initialization fails. Additionally, it sets the stop loss and take profit levels for all symbols based on the input parameters.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. It can be used to perform any necessary actions before termination.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the expert advisor and is called with every tick of the market. It performs the scalping strategy on each symbol specified in the input parameters. For each symbol, it checks if it matches any of the specified currency pairs and calls the `PerformScalpingStrategy()` function to execute the scalping strategy for that symbol.

## Perform Scalping Strategy Function

The `PerformScalpingStrategy()` function is responsible for executing the entry and exit logic of the scalping strategy for a given symbol. This is where you should add your own custom scalping strategy code. Additionally, it calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the input parameters and places pending orders with these levels. You can customize the pending order placement and order execution handling code according to your trading strategy.
